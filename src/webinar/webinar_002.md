## Webinar

We are excited to invite you to join our webinar to gain insights into network security. Our speaker has successfully proposed a method that secures the data transmission rate for legitimate receiver under interception by eavesdropper, while accounting for imperfect channel estimation. His study was accepted to publish in IEEE TVT, which is a high-quality journal.
